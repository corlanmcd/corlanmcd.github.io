[The stuff of nightmares.](https://alice961994.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/futurama-fry-stress.png) 

That was the expression of the majority of my classmates when our professor began describing pointers in my *Intro to C class* during my freshman year of college. I can tell you I've seen it on the faces of many entry-level software engineers as well.

For some people, the concept of pointers is a very hard concept to grasp, and is a common reason why many students loath C/C++ and jump on the Java or C# bandwagon ("Hurrah! No pointers!") because they'll never have to deal with a pointer or memory management again (Java and C# use references in leu of pointers).
